[THIS WILL BE CHANGED WHEN A CONTRIBUTOR IS ADDED OR CONSIDERED]

First off, thank you for considering contributing to UserMan. It's people like you that make Home Assist such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/userman/issues) if there's already a ticket for it. If there isn't, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/yourusername/userman/issues/new).

## Language

All communication will be done in English

## Documentation and way of working

You can find more info on the way of working in cooperative guidelines.

More info on the architecture and project decisions are documented in the code-guidelines.

## Contributing to the project

This can be done via GitHub. We describe it shortly here. A detailed description on how we work can be found in the cooperative guidelines.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork UserMan](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature-325-add-radar-chart
```

### Implement your fix or feature
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.  
#### Test your changes
If you're adding code, make sure you've added and updated the tests and they pass.  
### Create a pull request
At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with Home Assist's master branch:
Read the GitHub documentation on how to do this.

Then update your feature branch from your local copy, and push it!:
